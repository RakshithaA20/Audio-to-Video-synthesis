Audio-to-Video Synthesis using generative AI
This project demonstrates a cutting-edge approach to transforming audio recordings into videos using state-of-the-art AI models. The process begins with converting speech from an audio file into text through Wav2Vec2, a powerful speech-to-text model by Facebook. Once the spoken content is transcribed, the text is then fed into a text-to-video synthesis model, which generates a corresponding video.

The key steps in the process include:

Audio Processing: The audio file is loaded and pre-processed using the librosa library, ensuring it is ready for accurate transcription.

Speech-to-Text Transcription: The audio is then passed through the Wav2Vec2 model, where it is tokenized and processed to generate a text transcription of the speech.

Text-to-Video Synthesis: The transcribed text is used as input for the video synthesis model, which generates a video that visually represents the spoken content.

Output Video Generation: The resulting video is saved to the specified output path, completing the transformation from audio to video.

This project highlights the integration of advanced machine learning techniques to automate multimedia content creation, making it particularly useful for applications in content creation, education, and entertainment. The tool provides a seamless way to generate videos from audio inputs, enabling new possibilities for dynamic content generation.
